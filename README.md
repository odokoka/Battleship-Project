# Battleship-Project

This is the repo for one of my projects in the EECS 183 Class at the University of Michigan. I was tasked to create the classic, two player game of Battleship.

## Languages Utilized:
- C++

## Short Description:
- Developed a two-player Battleship game that utilized user-defined classes as well as test cases to verify the correct
functionality of member functions and class constructors
- Created algorithms that use conditionals and loops, and generated interactive input and output using C++
- Increased functionality of the game by adding AI that made more calculated moves depending on user input difficulty
- Utility files are used for supportive functions and Test files are edge case testing and modular developments
